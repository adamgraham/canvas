# [Canvas](https://adamgraham.io/art/canvas)

> Canvas is a never-ending, interactive painting. Alter the direction of the "brushes" and see what kind of abstract paintings you can create, or sit back and let it paint for you. Every thirty seconds the canvas is cleared and a new set of design principles are put in place. Learn to let go and design with the flow.
